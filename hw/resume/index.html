  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    With my focus in Marketing and my passion for Entrepreneurship and Creativity, my goal is to use my skills to think of innovative ways to enhance already existing companies or help grow a developing one. I chose Marketing because of the opportunity to
    creatively approach data-driven business development and branding decisions.
